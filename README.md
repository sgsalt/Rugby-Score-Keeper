# Rugby-Score-Keeper
A score keeping app for rugby, created for the Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree.

It's a simple app with columns for the home and away teams. You can add scores by hitting the appropriate score types, TRY (5), CONVERSION (2) PENALTY (3) and DROP GOAL (4). There's also a reset button to set the scores back to zero.
