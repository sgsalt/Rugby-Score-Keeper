Project: Score Keeper App

The goal is to create an Score Keeper app which gives a user the ability to keep track of the score of two different teams playing a game of your choice.

Rugby Score Keeper is a simple app with columns for the home and away teams. You can add scores by hitting the appropriate score types, TRY (5), CONVERSION (2) PENALTY (3) and DROP GOAL (4). There's also a reset button to set the scores back to zero.
